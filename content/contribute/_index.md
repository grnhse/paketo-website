### RFCs

If you'd like to learn more about the buildpacks architecture and the design
decisions being made, it may be helpful to read through some of our
[project-wide RFCs](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs). Some language
family buildpack repositories (e.g.
[Node.js](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs/tree/main/rfcs)) also
contain language-specific RFCs that may provide helpful context.
